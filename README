This is the start of what will be a website for an organization I am building extracurricularly.
It will eventually be paired with an app and database that allows customers to scan a store barcode or search manually for safety ratings of pet products.
My goal was to get initial landing and signup pages established and functional. In order to meet the project requirements, I converted my initial signup page to a popup lightbox form using jQuery.

To view:
-Run index.html
-Click on "Stay Informed" to see the lightbox jQuery form
-An alternate signup form is still in the project for those who are not able to run the jQuery form. Open "pages/signupform.html" to view.

While I am confident I have met the project requirements, I plan to do much, much more work on this project--so thanks in advance for any feedback you can offer!

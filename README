A brief description of your projectâ€™s purpose.
Example: "A website for my local animal shelter. I tried to enhance their current site by implementing more responsive design and adding some jQuery functionality to create a Contact Me form."
Try to think of what would be useful to a potential employer that is looking at your GitHub account without any context or background about Code Louisville or your project.
Detailed steps on how to view the website. For most projects, this may just be "Run index.html" But some projects may go beyond these requirements and require specific tools or setup to run.
If your project does, be sure to include very detailed steps so a reviewer or an employer can successfully run your project.
If you choose to host your site on a live URL or GitHub Pages, it is fine to list that URL instead.
